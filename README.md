also, a valid URL is acceptable:

![URL](assets/url.png)

## How does it work?

1. If argument passed is a valid URL, load it directly
2. If argument has version like `jquery@2`, try to load it from unpkg
3. Else, try to load it from cdnjs

Step 2 and 3 are also available as `$i.unpkg` or `$i.cdnjs`. If you are certain about which CDN to use, these are better choices.
